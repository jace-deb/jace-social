# Jace Social server and web app

The server behind Jace Social: friends, messages, group chats, servers and hosted worlds. It serves the web app at `/app` too.
Jace Launcher, the desktop app and the Jace Social mod all talk to it. It's a Next.js app on Vercel with a Supabase database.

## How it works

- **Sign-in:** works like joining a Minecraft server. The server hands out a one-time id, the client tells Mojang it "joined" it, and the server asks Mojang to confirm (`hasJoined`). Only the real account owner can do that. Minecraft tokens never reach this server, and only Microsoft accounts work.
- **Database access:** every table has row-level security on and no policies, so only the server (secret key) can read or write. Players go through `/api/v1/*` with a bearer token.
- **Live updates:** each player has a private, unguessable Supabase Realtime channel. Broadcasts only say what changed (never message text), and clients then fetch through the API.
- **Hosted worlds:** the mod opens your world to LAN, the e4all mod gives it a public address, and the address is shared with friends through your status.

## Setup (one time)

1. **Supabase:** create a free project at <https://supabase.com>.
   - **Security options when creating the project:** Data API **on**, "Automatically expose new tables" **off**, automatic RLS **on**.
   - **SQL Editor:** run `supabase/schema.sql`, then `supabase/002_calls.sql`, then `supabase/003_social.sql`. 003 adds Jace accounts, profiles, group chats, servers and the `avatars` storage bucket.
   - **Realtime → Settings:** make sure public channel access is allowed (it's the default).
   - **Project Settings → API Keys:** copy the project URL, the **publishable** key and the **secret** key.
2. **Vercel:** New Project, then import `jace-deb/jace-social`.
   - **Root Directory:** `server`
   - **Project name:** `jace-social` (that gives `https://jace-social.vercel.app`, the address the launcher and mod use).
   - **Environment variables:** `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (see `.env.example`).
   - **Sign in with Jace:** register an app at Jace with this redirect URI:
     `https://jace-social.vercel.app/api/v1/auth/jace/callback`
     Then add `JACE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `JACE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
   - Deploy.

## API (`/api/v1`, `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)

| Method | Path | |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `auth/start` → `{server_id}` | step 1 of sign-in (no auth) |
| POST | `auth/finish` `{name, server_id}` | step 2: returns `{token, uuid, inbox, realtime}` |
| POST | `auth/signout` | |
| GET | `me` | |
| GET | `friends` | friends with status and unread counts, plus incoming and outgoing requests |
| POST | `friends` `{name}` | send a request (works even if they haven't signed up yet) |
| DELETE | `friends?uuid=` | remove a friend or cancel/decline a request |
| POST | `friends/respond` `{uuid, accept}` | |
| POST | `presence` `{activity}` / `{offline: true}` | heartbeat every ~2 min |
| GET | `messages?with=&before=` | 50 newest, oldest first |
| POST | `messages` `{to, body}` | friends only, 500 chars max, 20/min |
| POST | `messages/read` `{with}` | |
| POST | `calls` `{to, call_id, kind, sdp?}` | voice call setup (offer / answer / hangup), friends only |
| GET | `calls?id=` | read a call signal sent to you (the live `call` event carries its id) |
| GET | `calls/ice` | STUN/TURN servers for calls |

## Voice calls

Calls are made in Jace Launcher (the Jace Friends mod controls them through the launcher). Audio goes straight between the two players with WebRTC. When a direct connection isn't possible, it goes through Cloudflare's free TURN relay.

Setup:
1. In Supabase's **SQL Editor**, run `supabase/002_calls.sql`.
2. Optional, for the relay: in the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Realtime → TURN Server → Create**. Then add these Vercel environment variables and redeploy:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_ID`: the Turn Token ID
   - `CLOUDFLARE_TURN_API_TOKEN`: the API token
   Without them, calls still work for most home networks (STUN only).
