# Jace Social desktop app changelog

## 1.0.5
- **Game overlay:** pick a keyboard shortcut in Settings (for example Ctrl+Shift+J) and press it in a game: Jace Social pops up on top, small, on the side of the screen. Press it again (or Esc) to hide it. It's the same Jace Social as the main window, so calls and voice keep going. Drag its top bar to move it; it remembers where. Works over games in windowed or borderless mode (not exclusive fullscreen). On macOS, allow Jace Social under Accessibility the first time. On Linux it needs X11 (games through XWayland and Proton work too).
- **Open on startup** is now a switch in Settings: turn starting Jace Social when you sign in to your computer on or off any time.
- The tray menu has **Show overlay**.

## 1.0.4
- **Updates like Jace Launcher:** the app checks for a new version a few seconds after it starts (and every few hours while it's open in the tray), then asks **Update now** or **Later** and shows what's new. It asks once per version; the green **Update** button stays in the sidebar until you update.
- **Check for updates on startup** can be turned off in Settings, next to **Check for updates**.

## 1.0.3
- Fixes "no permission" when turning on your camera in a call or voice channel.
- Screen sharing works in the app: pick your whole screen or one window to share.
- macOS asks for camera access the first time you turn your camera on.

## 1.0.2
- Fixes Sign in with Minecraft showing a blank white window.
- Invite links open in the app: on an invite page, click **Open in the desktop app**.
- Everything new in Jace Social shows up in the app too: servers with roles, voice channels, screen sharing, bots, themes and more. Those come from the web app, so they work right away.

## 1.0.1
- Linux: fixes the app not starting on newer distros ("Could not initialize GLX"). The AppImage now uses your system's own graphics, GTK and GLib libraries instead of older copies, and is 25 MB smaller.

## 1.0.0
- First release: Jace Social in its own window - friends, direct messages, group chats and servers.
- Sign in with Jace or with Minecraft (Microsoft), and link the other one any time.
- Notifications and a tray icon, so messages reach you while the window is closed. It can start when you sign in to your computer.
- Voice calls with friends, whether they use the app, the web, or Jace Launcher.
- Every download is the app itself: open it once and a short setup installs it (Windows, macOS and Linux), adds shortcuts, starts the installed copy and removes the download.
- One-click updates: an **Update** button appears when a new version is out (also in Settings and the tray menu).
- Settings → Delete Jace Social removes the app, and optionally your sign-in on this computer.
